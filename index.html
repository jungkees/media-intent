          This is a demo of W3C DAP WG's <a href='http://w3c-test.org/dap/gallery/'>Pick Media Intent</a> specification.

        <h2>Making It Work</h2>
        <p>
          First, you need to be running a reasonably recent version of Chrome (I think 19+ will do). In a real
          version this would work with all browsers of course.
        </p>
        <p>
          Then you need to download the extension that register the Intent. This demo provides two services,
          <a href='flickr.zip'>flickr search</a> and <a href='youtube.zip'>YouTube search</a>. In the
          real version this could be registered by the service page directly, but that isn't supported just
          yet.
        </p>
        <p>
          Unpack the manifest, and follow these steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Open the <a href='chrome://chrome/extensions' target='_blank'>chrome://chrome/extensions</a> page</li>
          <li>Check the “Developer mode” box if you haven't already</li>
          <li>Click “Load unpacked extension” and select the directory that contains the manifest in the dialog</li>
          <li>
            This should install an extension with an icon and all.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          Once that's done, go to the <a href='client' target='_blank'>client page</a> (or you can write your own!). If 
          you load media there, you should normally be prompted to select from registered Pick Media Intent services. 
          Choosing that will open the service page, which in turn will allow you to search and pick some media objects.
        </p>

        <h2>Current Status of the Spec</h2>
        <p>
          Pick Media Intent is in FPWD and DAP WG is moving the spec toward LC. You can share your valuable
          feedback in <a href='mailto://public-device-apis@w3.org'>DAP's public email list</a>. Also, any reference 
          service implementation is welcome to us!
